Twitter Sentiment Analysis in Python: Instructions
==================================================

Twitter represents a fundamentally new instrument to make social measurements. Millions of people voluntarily express opinions across any topic imaginable --- this data source is incredibly valuable for both research and business.
 
For example, researchers have shown that the "mood" of communication on twitter reflects biological rhythms and can even used to predict the stock market. A student here at UW used geocoded tweets to plot a map of locations where "thunder" was mentioned in the context of a storm system in Summer 2012.
Researchers from Northeastern University and Harvard University studying the characteristics and dynamics of Twitter have an excellent resource for learning more about this area.
 
In this assignment, you will
 
1. access the twitter Application Programming Interface(API) using python.
2. estimate the public's perception (the sentiment) of a particular term or phrase.
3. analyze the relationship between location and mood based on a sample of twitter data.
 
This assignment is open-ended in several ways. You'll need to make some decisions about how best to solve the problem.
